# Hugo Habel

Hi, I'm Hugo – I'm a senior software engineer with more than 16 years of experience. As part of my career, I have fulfilled the roles of technical lead, and engineering manager. My area of expertise is front-end development with React, and I’m in the process of immersing myself into native iOS development with Swift and Swift UI. I have experience in the entire process of software development, from requirements to release, in both small and large scale applications. I have worked at some start-ups as well as at larger corporations, always being part of amazing teams.

## Core values

🤝 High commitment 

👥 Team work

💎 High-quality work

## Portfolio

I decided to focus my portfolio on the area that attracts my interest the most, web front-end, and iOS development. To get more information about each project, please refer to their README.md file (when available), or send me a message to request access to the repository.

- [Amelia Start Page](https://hugohabel.github.io/amelia-start-page/) – This project showcases my abilities in web front-end with React.js and TypeScript. It includes automated tests with Jest and react-testing-library. *This project is in a very early stage, and is still a work in progress*.

### SwiftUI Portfolio

*All the apps in this section are just small projects to practice my abilities with SwiftUI. They are by no means a full project or a complete app.*
